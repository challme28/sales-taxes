# Sales Taxes

This project is a `react` based web application compliant with a code assessment provided by [number8](https://www.number8.com/)
for the client [DealerOn](https://www.dealeron.com/). It uses `redux` to handle internal state management and `react-redux`
to obtain desired sections of our state three. However, the solution did not require the uses of states.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the 
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Problem
There are a variety of items for sale at a store. When a customer purchases items, they receive a receipt. The receipt 
lists of all the items purchased, the sales price of each item (with taxes included), the total sales taxes for all items,
and the total sales price.<br/>
Basic sales tax applies to all items at a rate of 10% of the itemâ€™s list price, except books, food, and
medical products, which are exempt from basic sales tax. An import duty (import tax) applies to all imported items at
a rate of 5% of the shelf price, with no exceptions.<br/>
Write an application that takes input for shopping baskets and returns receipts in the format shown below, calculating
all taxes and totals correctly. When calculating the sales tax, round the value up to the nearest 5 cents. For example, if
a taxable item costs $5.60, an exact 10% tax would be $0.56, and the final price after adding the rounded tax of $0.60
should be $6.20.
